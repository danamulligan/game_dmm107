### Breakout Variant
The variant that most grabbed my attention was "Bricks n Balls,"
mostly due to the fact that it was the only variation of Breakout that I ever 
consistently played. There was a period in 2017 where the only thing I ever did
on my phone was play an app called "Ballz" (before I deleted it to stop playing it).
The other variations always became too stressful for me to play and weren't enjoyable. 
What I liked about this variant was that it was easier to plan ahead for future moves,
and it seemed to be more logical. It's a clever idea to include the number of hits needed
to break a block on the block, as well as increasing the "ammunition" each play. 
### General Level Descriptions
**Level 1** will have a few rows of bricks, with no power ups or penalties.
An example of the layout (where numbers correspond to number of hits needed
to break a brick) of level 1 is:

**Level 3** will have 

### Bricks Ideas
 - bricks require a different number of hits to break, and have corresponding colors
 - power up bricks that when hit give some sort of reward, and break after one hit
 
### Power Up Ideas
 - grow ball size
 - widen paddle
 - slow down ball
 - increase paddle speed

### Cheat Key Ideas
 - jump to different levels by clicking the corresponding number key, "1" for level 1,
 "2" for level 2, etc.
 - "w" for win game
 - "r" for reset current level 
 - "l" to add a life
 - "p" for pause? afterwards the y speed and the x speed of the ball will go to
 zero and then save the values, then hitting "c" for continue will put them back to what
 they were before
 - "b" for begin, clearing the splash screen. The player then must press "space" to
 start the ball moving
 - "q" for automatic lose
### Something Extra
 - add penalty bricks
 - death zone where the paddle splits into multiple pieces?
