### Breakout Variant
The variant that most grabbed my attention was "Bricks n Balls,"
mostly due to the fact that it was the only variation of Breakout that I ever 
consistently played. There was a period in 2017 where the only thing I ever did
on my phone was play an app called "Ballz" (before I deleted it to stop playing it).
The other variations always became too stressful for me to play and weren't enjoyable. 
What I liked about this variant was that it was easier to plan ahead for future moves,
and it seemed to be more logical. It's a clever idea to include the number of hits needed
to break a block on the block, as well as increasing the "ammunition" each play.
