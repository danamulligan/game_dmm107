# Game Plan

### Breakout Variant
The variant that most grabbed my attention was "Bricks n Balls,"
mostly due to the fact that it was the only variation of Breakout that I ever 
consistently played. There was a period in 2017 where the only thing I ever did
on my phone was play an app called "Ballz" (before I deleted it to stop playing it).
The other variations always became too stressful for me to play and weren't enjoyable. 
What I liked about this variant was that it was easier to plan ahead for future moves,
and it seemed to be more logical. It's a clever idea to include the number of hits needed
to break a block on the block, as well as increasing the "ammunition" each play. 
### General Level Descriptions

### Bricks Ideas
I would like to include bricks that take a different number of hits to break,
and give them different colors to distinguish between them. 
### Power Up Ideas
 - grow ball size
 - widen paddle
 -
### Cheat Key Ideas
 - jump to different levels by clicking the corresponding number key, "1" for level 1,
 "2" for level 2, etc.
 - "w" for win game
 - "r" for reset current level 
 - "p" for pause? afterwards the y speed and the x speed of the ball will go to
 zero and then save the values, then hitting "c" for continue will put them back to what
 they were before
 - "b" for begin, clearing the splash screen. The player then must press "space" to
 start the ball moving
### Something Extra
 - add penalty bricks
 - death zone where the paddle splits into two?
